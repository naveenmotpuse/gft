            While walking on the beach, you find that a copy of Daniel Defoeâ€™s Robinson Crusoe has washed ashore.  Having been working every day since you were stranded you would enjoy being able to take the time to read about someone else who was stranded.  Reading the book will take ten hours.   Produce enough without allocating all of your time so that you can survive by trading with Friday.  Remember that you must survive each night and Friday will only trade if he is made better off than he would have been on his own.  Any time not allocated will be used to read.
